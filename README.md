The beersong

In this puzzle, write code to print out the entire "99 bottles of beer on the wall" song.

For those who do not know the song, the lyrics follow this form:

X bottles of beer on the wall
X bottles of beer
Take one down, pass it around
X-1 bottles of beer on the wall

X-1 bottles of beer on the wall
...
Take one down, pass it around
0 bottles of beer on the wall
Where X and X-1 are replaced by numbers of course.

Grammatical support for "1 bottle of beer" is optional.
